<h2 align="center">My name is Dip Rawal. 👋🤓</h2>
<p align="center">I'm a software developer and mentor. I'm a big fan of backend development however I've worked on full stack most of the time. I love JavaScript and Python as my key langauges while I'm busy adding Kotlin as well as I see these languages as having the most growth and flexibilty. I love animals, watching the good ol TV and just sitting on 9gag when I'm not in the trenches of codewar 3.</p>
